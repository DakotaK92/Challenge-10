## SVG Generator
I created a SVG Generator, with a couple of questions you can make a new logo for your company!

To do you this you have to run the code local using Node.js. You aslo have to have Inquirer and Jest installed from npm to run this program.

With these questions you can make a logo!
What shape do you want your logo? Square, Circle or Triangle? 
What color do you want that shape to be?
What is the name of your company?
What color do you want the font to be for your logo?
